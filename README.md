# Text Extraction and Feature Extraction from Images and PDFs

This project demonstrates text extraction and feature extraction from images and PDFs using **Tesseract OCR** and **Python**. It is designed to process scanned images or PDF documents and extract meaningful textual data.

---

## Features

- **OCR Processing**: Utilizes Tesseract OCR for text extraction.
- **Image Support**: Processes various image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
- **PDF Support**: Converts PDF pages to images and extracts text.
- **Custom Preprocessing**: Allows image preprocessing to improve OCR accuracy.

## Prerequisites

### Required Libraries and Tools

- Python 3.7+
- Tesseract OCR
- pytesseract
- OpenCV
- Pillow (PIL)
- PyPDF2 (for PDF processing)

You can install all Python dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure Tesseract OCR is installed on your system:

```bash
# For Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

---

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/text-extraction.git
   cd text-extraction
   ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Verify Tesseract installation:
   ```bash
   which tesseract
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Notebook

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook TextExtraction.ipynb
   ```

2. Execute the cells step-by-step:
   - Install dependencies.
   - Load and preprocess images or PDFs.
   - Extract text using Tesseract OCR.

### Using as a Script

1. Modify the script to specify the input file (image or PDF).
2. Run the extraction process:
   ```bash
   python text_extraction.py --input <path_to_file>
   ```
